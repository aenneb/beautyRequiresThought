% Previously included in larger function that also reads in data and plots

% V2: Aenne Brielmann
% May 22, 2016
% Generalize the function to handle data of variable length and data
% matrices containing different numbers of subjects
% include t, tOn, and tOff as input to this function rather than specifying
% here

% V4: Aenne Brielmann
% June 3, 2016
% generalize to tOn and tOff that can vary

% V5: Aenne Brielmann
% June 3, 2016
% add a fast exponential to the decay exponential that has the same time
% constant as the initial increase
